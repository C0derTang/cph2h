/**
 * Import a user's Codeforces solve history into `user_problems`.

 * Extracted from the old password-login link route so the compile-error
 * verification flow (`POST /api/cf/verify/check`) can reuse the exact same
 * import logic. Walks the user's full submission history via the public
 * `user.status` API (paginated) and marks `user_problems.solved`.
 *
 * `importSolveHistoryIncremental` (issue #69) layers an incremental variant
 * on top for the ready-time refresh: newest-first, stopping at the first
 * submission older than the user's last sync, so problems solved after
 * link time are excluded from selection without re-walking the whole history
 * on every race.
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE (tracked on issue #32, deferred — need infra/schema changes):
 *  - Moving this off the request path onto a background job/queue so a function
 *    timeout can't abort mid-import.
 *  - Allowing provisional `user_problems` rows for problems not yet in the
 *    `problems` catalogue (the unseen-problem FK limitation).
